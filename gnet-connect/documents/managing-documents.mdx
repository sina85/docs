## Document Visibility Levels

When adding documents, you can set different visibility levels to control access:

- Private - Only visible to your organization
- Public - Visible to all GNet Connect users
- Selected Partners - Visible only to chosen business partners

<Warning>
Always verify the visibility level before saving sensitive documents to ensure proper access control.
</Warning>
